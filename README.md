## Inspiration

We wanted to create a silly, joyful game that brings back the fun of keeping a balloon in the air — but with a twist!  
Our inspirations include:
- Childhood memories of keeping balloons afloat
- Endless arcade games from the 2010s (like *Fruit Ninja*)
- Early internet aesthetics: Windows XP, early Facebook design, and stylized animations to recapture nostalgia.

The name **Keep It Up!** serves as a double meaning:
- Keep the balloon in the air
- A cheerful message of encouragement (accompanied by a thumbs up!)

## Features

- 🎮 **Webcam-Based Gameplay**  
  Control the game with your hands using MediaPipe hand tracking!

- 🎈 **Balloon Mechanics**  
  Tap the balloon to keep it airborne — let it fall, and it's game over.

- 💣 **Bombs & Hazards**  
  Watch out for bombs that drop randomly! Touch one, and the game ends.

- 🧮 **Scoring System**  
  Keep track of your taps and aim for a high score.

- 🏆 **Leaderboard**  
  Save your scores and compete! View your current and previous scores from the main menu.

- 🔊 **Settings Menu**  
  Adjust game volume to your liking.

## How It Works

1. Launch the game in your browser.
2. The webcam captures your hand movements.
3. MediaPipe detects your hand landmarks.
4. Use your hand to tap the balloon and avoid bombs.
5. Once the game ends, save your score and check the leaderboard!
